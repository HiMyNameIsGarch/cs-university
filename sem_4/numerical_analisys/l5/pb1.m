% In the following table there are some data regarding a moving car. Use
% Hermite interpolation to estimate position and speed of the car when the time
% is t = 10.

% Time      0  3   5   8   13
% Distance  0  225 383 623 993
% Speed     75 77  80  74   72

time = [0 3 5 8 13];
distance = [0 225 383 623 993];
speed = [75 77 80 74 72];
